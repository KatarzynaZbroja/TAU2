Google creates a cloud in Poland.

Partner of PKO BP

The operator of the National Cloud, a company of PKO BP and PFR, has entered into a strategic partnership with Google.

The cooperation is intended to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of computing cloud technologies.

Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the National Cloud Operator, and Google will open in Warsaw the so called. Google Cloud region-a hub for technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the CEE region.

The Google Cloud region will be the first installation of a global, public computing cloud in Central Europe.

The digitization of Polish companies was one of the key assumptions underlying the project of creating the National Cloud, initiated and expelled by PKO Bank Polski and by the Polish Development Fund, the shareholders of this company.

The Partnership of the National Cloud and Google is another important step on the road that we set out less than a year ago, announcing the establishment of the National Cloud Operator.

The aim remains unchanged-the digitization of the Polish economy and the dynamism of its growth.

"" "Now Polish companies are gaining additional, sophisticated tools for its implementation."

Using them, they increase their chances of advancement to the world league, what we care about all about.

"The fact that to their company is joining Google today, indeed strengthens our joint project" ", says Zbigniew Jagiełło, President of PKO Bank Polski."

The Polish Development Fund points out that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and businesses.

"" "The investment in the National Cloud Operator is ideally suited to the PFR strategy as an essential element of the digitization of the country."

Tasmanian devils can provide clues on cancer treatment

Tasmanian devils may have a key to cancer treatment-researchers have made a breakthrough discovery that can revolutionize therapy for patients

Researchers in the field of medicine have discovered a way of masking some cancer cells

The researchers found that the same process exists in the Tasmanian devils and in humans.

There is hope that this discovery will bring new methods of treating oncological patients

What do they have to do with the Tasmanian devils and the people?

Neoplastic cells that can become invisible.

Researchers, including those from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, have made a landmark discovery that could help revolutionize the therapy of some cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.

It may also contain the key to the treatment of deadly tumors within the face, threatening the future of the endangered Tasmanian devil.

The study determined how to mask some of the cancer cells in both humans and torbans, using a group of proteins called PRC2, which turns off a marker that would otherwise signal the immune system to attack the cancer.

This may be the biggest challenge in the treatment of small-cell lung cancer, neuroblastomy and the type of skin cancer called Merkel cell carcinoma.

"" "The huge importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop immunity to immune therapies, we may be able to reverse this process," "said AAP chief researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac."

Existing therapies can be directed to re-enable markers, proteins called MHC, which will allow the immune system to recognize the cancer cells.

"" "Potentially this has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer," "said Professor Dawson."

"" "It is one of the most common diseases on earth."

And perhaps we can manage to treat her much better.

Researchers also hope that the discovery will once be used to treat the tumors of the face of the Tasmanian devil, where cancer cells in a similar manner avoid detection.

"" "It is unjust that exactly the same process occurs (in the case of neoplasms in humans and in Tasmanian devils)," "stated Professor Dawson."

"" "So far it has been very difficult to treat tasmanic devils' tumors."

"But if the drugs in humans can also be used in Tasmanian devils, there is a possibility that this will help control the disease" "."

The scientists astonished the fact that around a really small star is circling a very large planet

Scientists are astonished after the discovery of a solar system located 30 light-years from Earth, which undermines our current understanding of the processes of planets formation, as in this arrangement a large planet similar to Jupiter is circling a small star called red dwarf.

An artistic illustration of the planet's gas-type giant GJ 3512b circulating around the central star being a red dwarp, published on 26 September 2019.

In general, stars are much larger than even the largest planets circling around them.

However, as scientists said on Thursday, in this case the star and planet slightly differ in size.

The size of a star named GJ 3512 is about 12% of the size of the Sun, while the mass of the planet that revolves around it is at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet of our solar system.

"" "Yes, it's an absolute surprise," "said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Catalan Institute of Space Research at the Spanish Institute of Space Research, which has been at the forefront of research published in the journal Science."

The discovery is surprising, as the theoretical models of the formation of solar systems suggest that low-mass stars usually become parent stars for smaller planets similar to Earth or smaller Neptunes.

"" "In this case, we discovered a gas-type planet giant similar to Jupiter circling a very small star," "added Morales."

The planet, which, like Jupiter, consists mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.

It encircled its star after a very elliptical orbit, and the full lap lasts 204 days.

The red dwarfs are small and have a relatively low surface temperature.

The star GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than the Sun, but to some extent it has a size comparable to the size of a very large planet, as it is only about approx. 35% higher than Jupiter.

They emit less energy, so they are pale than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and it is roughly below 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).

"" "That's why they have a reddish color," "said Morales."

"" "There is evidence of the existence of the second planet currently circulating around this star, while the third planet may have been expelled from the star system in the past, which may explain the elliptical orbit of a planet similar to Jupiter," " stated Morales. "

The planets are formed from the same interstellar drive of gas and dust that gives birth to the star around which planets are circulating.

According to the leading model of the formation of planets called the model of acretion, initially the object is formed from particles in the disk, and the force of gravity of the planet in the early stage of development allows the formation of the atmosphere from the surrounding gas.

This unusual arrangement can explain a competitive model called the gravitational instability model.

"" "In such a case, a protoplanetary disc around a young star can be a bit more massive than we expect and it can be cold," "said Morales."

This leads to a disk stability disorder, and therefore some dense areas may occur.

These masses may rise up to the point of collapse and the creation of a planet.

A delicatessen worker accused of providing coworkers with a bean of a bean containing methamphetamine.

The County Sheriff's Office in Marion County has detained Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38, for giving co-workers of a facolar dip containing methamphetamine.

On Thursday, Albany 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez was accused of providing methamphetamine and causing the consumption of this substance controlled by another person-both crimes are second-degree crimes.

The accusation was made on the basis of the 9/9 event taking place at the Thriftway grocery store in Jefferson.

In the OregonLive.com portal, a statement made under oath indicating the likelihood of guilt by a 27-year-old female suspect told the Marion County Sheriff's deputies that she had seen Medina-Hernandez dip the beans during her lunch break, which she then gave her a chance to do.

"On the basis of the statement, it is known that the victim of the crime, which according to what she gave to the investigator, never took metamfetamine, said that she" "thought that one of the pieces eaten by her tasted strangely, but it did not raise any suspicions "". "

When she came back to work, she felt like she had a stomach upset and that she couldn't fix her legs.

According to the Albany Democrat-Herald newspaper, she went to the local hospital, where it was found that the bean dip could contain methamphetamine.

"Based on the news portal The Smoking Gun according to police another Thriftway network employee said that Medina-Hernandez" "told her that she would add drugs to food" ", while another admitted that the suspect sent her a message claiming that methamphetamine had hit the bean's dip by accident. "

The OregonLive website informs about a delicatessen recording of the delicatessen, which supposedly shows how the back of the camera back to the camera Medina-Hernandez pulls something out of the bra, becomes a microwave and tilt.

Then it straightales, wipes out the nose, walks to the table and puts the bean dip in a small paper vessel.

According to the police, the thing that she pulled out of the bra was probably on the platter.

The Oregon newspaper Statesman-Journal reports that the employees of the sheriff's office say that there is currently no suspicion that customers are given tainted food.

Medina-Hernandez is in Marion County Jail- $ 520,000 bail-out.

According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police record indicates that the woman was already convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, metamfetamine delivery, theft, possession of methamphetamine and possession of an illicit weapon.

Marian Banaś.

What does KAS do about the head of the NIK?

Renting real estate for an amount below the market price-this is the reservations that arise in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control of Marian Banasia.

About what the Treasury is doing in this matter we asked in the House of Treasury Administration in Krakow and the Ministry of Finance.

"Bertold Kittel in the reportage for" "Supervision" "TVN presented doubts about the property statements of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control of Marian Banasia."

He's been investigating the Central Anticorruption Bureau for several months.

The audit is due to end in the second half of October, already after the parliamentary elections.

According to the statements, Banaś was supposed to rent a tenement house with an area of ​​400 square meters and two smaller flats.

In total, 65.7 thousand zlotys were received for this year.

"The reportage of" "Supervision" "revealed that in the tenement house he was rented by the hotel for hours."

The Head of the NIK later translated into state television, why he would charge only slightly more than 5 thousand zlotys per month for renting the property.

"" "Gazeta Wyborcza" ", referring to the experts from the valuation of the property, because it estimated that the building itself should be 15 thousand zlotys per month."

"" "The amount was lower for a simple reason: I entered into an initial contract and it was precisely that the tenant was to buy this tenement, that I agreed to a lower rent that the remaining receivables would be accounted for when selling the tenement house "", argued Banaś. "

However, there were doubts as to whether such a procedure was not a violation of the law.

"Konrad Zawada, spokesperson for the Chamber of Treasury Administration in Krakow, told TVN24 that" "the Ministry of Finance is directly concerned with this matter" "."

"" "Any such questions please direct to the finance minister," "he added."

"In such cases, he explained that in such cases," "the National Treasury Administration" "is running" "activities." ""

A spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance Paweł Jurek admitted that the National Treasury Administration itself is monitoring a number of cases that could raise some reservations.

"" "The National Treasury Administration works in this way that it has its own information, as well as it is based in a sense on this information, which is available to the public."

"On this basis, it takes decisions, whether a specific case should lead to possible proceedings, or not," "the MF spokesman explained."

"" "On the other hand, because we have all the treasury secrets throughout the finance ministry, we never speak out because we cannot speak on individual cases of a particular taxpayer, a particular individual or a particular company," "he stressed, questioned about the case of Marian Banasia. "

"Minister of Finance Jerzy Kwieciński stressed that" "the tax offices do not transmit to the public this type of news" "."

"" "It is known that the entire treasury apparatus is dealing with very many similar cases across the country," "he pointed out."

Secrets of the royal family: revealed surprising guests often flying royal airplane

As part of their official duties, members of the Royal Family have to travel hundreds of journeys around the world during their lifetime.

This usually makes it easier for a royal plane-a private car that is caring a royal family all over the world for important events and speeches.

It's no surprise that having one's own plane is bound to be a privilege.

Members of the royal family do not have to stand in long queues for check-in, they do not have their baggage allowance limits and, as it turns out, they can invite you to board any guests-in this really unprecedented one.

According to the recently released premiere on Channel 5 of the documentary, not only the Queen and Prince Philip are often traveling by the Royal Airplane.

"During the program titled" "Royal Secrets of Flight" "the former navigation of the Queen's flights revealed that together with the royal family, the futsal guests were often flying."

"Bob Shields said:" "Sometimes together with our very important royal guests may have flown very important royal dogs." ""

It does not surprise the fact that the Queen may have wished her beloved favorites to accompany her in her travels, as she is known for her deep attachment to the dogs of the corgi breed.

From the earliest years, Queen Elizabeth has been a lover of these four creatures and has been listening to the fact that since the coronation, she has been the owner of over 30 corgi.

It is said that in 2007. had five corgi: Monty, Emma, ​​Linneta, Willow and Holly.

They included five cocker panickers: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Span, as well as four dogs being a corgi crossover from corgi: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.

The crew of the royal plane certainly had the hands full of robots.

A staff member of the royal house leaving the dogs and asking them to do their needs before taking them on board, says Shields, who is now in the process of taking them on board.

It's nice to tell you that there has never been any incident.

The program also revealed a shocking number of luggage, which the Queen takes with him on board during the journey in the exercise of official duties.

"The narrator of the film stated:" "In 1953 The queen on her journey of 70 000 kilometers took her luggage weighing 12 tons." ""

In order to be able to do this better, it's about as much as two huge elephants.

However, the Queen is not the only person who has a soft spot for fashion.

Apparently, the Duchess of Cambridge also has her own tastes for the carriage of her wardrobe-it is said that each of her dresses is devoted to a separate seat.

The new law comes into force.

Victims of accidents will receive an annuity

"On Friday, a regulation providing a seriously injured person in the event of a further disbursement of pensions comes into force," "informs the Financial Ombudsman."

This is about the Act of 9 July 2019. of the specific rights of the injured persons in the event of exhaustion of the guarantee sum established on the basis of the rules applicable before 1 January 2006.

It concerns the persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.

At that time, they were definitely lower than the guarantee totals, and in some cases the insurers had already ceased to pay their rent.

"" "I am happy with this regulation, because our institution has been seeking to create a mechanism for many years to provide a seriously injured person with a guarantee of financial support from OC insurance or OC farmer, despite the exhaustion of the guarantee sum" ", says Aleksander Daszewski, Legal Counsel at the Financial Ombudsman's Office."

According to the Financial Ombudsman, this was essential, because it is often a very tragic situation for people in a very poor state of health, which, for example, could not, for example, be in the case of accidents. work and at the same time incur significant costs of post-accident rehabilitation treatment.

Some of them were no longer considered to be countervailable and for increased need, due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of the so-called 'guarantee sums on the OC policies.

Parts threatened to do so in the coming years.

Until 1 January 2006 the limits of the insurer's liability were significantly lower than the current.

Therefore, the problem of the exhaustion of the amount of guarantee in previous years was most often affected by the people who suffered damage in the 1990s.

At that time, the guarantee totals were very low, and the economic conditions caused the price increase.

"" "We have also noticed that this problem has also affected a number of mostly young people who have suffered damage during the period when the amount was 350,000. Euro per person affected by the accident."

Currently, it is 5.21 million euros per event, regardless of the number of aggrieved.

"It is therefore a huge difference in relation to earlier periods, hence the problem required the intervention of the legislator" ", recalls Aleksander Daszewski."

It that the guarantee sum of some time is increased, the legislator has assumed that the upper limit of the liability of the Insurance Guarantee Fund will be the guarantee sum in force at the time of referral to the Fund for payment of the pension.

This rule shall apply if the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay the pension on the basis of a court decision setting a different amount of the guarantee amount than the one set in the OC insurance contract.

This shall be the case in the case of an increase in the amount of the guarantee by way of judicial proceedings under Article 4. 3571 of the Civil Code, which enables modification of an existing liability relationship.

"" "In recent days, we have sent letters to people who have in the past addressed us with a request to intervene."

"We inform in them about new powers and of course we provide for the possibility of giving further support in case of any problems arise" ", says Aleksander Daszewski."

Hotel Trumpa retains permission to sell alcohol despite the complaint on the owner's disposition

WASHINGTON (AP) -Commission ds. Washington, DC, has given a request to check whether a local Trump International Hotel facility should be allowed to lose its license to sell alcohol due to its owner's disposition.

The agency ordered on Wednesday that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbis are unfounded, as most of them do not live in the district or have real estate in it.

'The Washington Post' states that it is the second time that these claimants are seeking to withdraw the hotel's permission for the sale of alcohol, citing the district's provision that applicants for permission to sell alcohol must show a 'good disposition'.

In the original complaint filed last summer, it was claimed that President Donald Trump would break the law, and cited assault accusations and repeated cases of fraud.

The complaint was dismissed as the license was granted before it was lodged.

The reason for the second complaint was to extend the authorization.

'The Sun': A crushing report recognizes known from the police service scandals in Cleveland for the worst in the UK

The inspectors considered the police scandals to be the worst in the UK.

In a crushing report, they assessed Cleveland's police work as inappropriate in all areas.

"Phil Gormley from Her Majesty's Chief Police Inspectorate says that there has been a" "significant deterioration" "in the Cleveland Police Service."

We have a visualization of skatepark!

Finally, will the young people wait?

Young people are disturbable by young people who are passionate about scooters and skateboards, and they are complaining that there is no suitable place for them in Oława.

Young people have been dopomed for years to ride on rollers, skateboards, scooters, bikes.

The subject is still coming back to our tears.

For 10 years, we have been paying attention to this problem.

Lately, it's been loud about the lack of skatepark again.

That's why we go back to that, and we're going to ask the office what's next?

We remind you that a few days ago, a woman who was in the center of the center was distured by her.

"" "I write on behalf of the inhabitants of the bloc at pl. Piłsudski, in order to be interested in the situation of olawska youth" ", writes for Małgorzata's editorial office."

"" "The residents of the bloc have called repeatedly to the City Guard unsuccessfully."

"For proof of such everyday situations in the attached consignment of photographs" "."

We have asked others about this matter.

Most unequivocally states that young people simply have nowhere to drive in the city and for years have been unsuccessfully demanding a place for themselves.

Under the post on Facebook, there appeared to be an avalango of comments.

Already in July we wrote that there was a chance for skatepark to be built on the Oławskie Miasteczko.

The mayor reported that the city had requested funding for the skatepark construction.

"" "Consulted with the youth project together with the permits is ready."

"On 28 March, the Ministry of Sport and Tourism was requested to finance the task of the task of the Ministry of Sport and Tourism." "Construction of Skatepark in Oława" "within the framework of the Sports Program Poland" ", we were told in the office. "

Total value of the project: PLN 798 306.00.

Requested amount of funding: PLN 263 440.00.

Now we have asked again at what stage is the case.

"" "We do not yet have information on the settlement, which is submitted to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism of the application for funding", informs Elżbieta Bednarczyk, the Head of the Department of European Funds of the UM Oława. "

"" "From information obtained from the Ministry's employees it is clear that ultimately the selection of all tasks within the Sportowa Polska Program should take place in October" "."

We also asked for the visualization of the olawski skatepark.

We present it below.

The youth has informed the editorial that next Saturday (28 September) they will collect signatures on a petition concerning the construction of a skatepark in Oława.

"" "Bunting youth saw the last post on Facebook and came to the conclusion that they would organize a fundraiser," "writes the editorial office of Santa Claus."

The signatures on the petition will be collected from 12.00 hours in the area of ​​Lidl's brand.

Polish Cup 2019/20: draw 1/16 finals.

We know the couple, hit the years ago

It was one of the most fiercest rivalries in the extraclassroom.

The greatest legend has been the memorable match of the 1996/1997 season.

On June 18, 1997, Legia took part in the old stadium on the Łazienkowska, the Łódź team in the foremost queue.

Both teams shared the point.

The hosts had to win, Widzew the second consecutive championship of Poland gave a point.

Up to 87. minute Legia led 2: 0, but for five consecutive minutes there was an earthquake-Widzew scored three goals and enjoyed the title.

The Łódź club has fallen into increasing trouble over the years until it has ceased to count in the championship fight and has fallen from the top-notch of the championship.

For the last time, both teams met at this level in the 2013/2014 season.

Legia-on the way to the title-suffered two victories-5: 1 at each other and 1: 0 on the exit.

Back to elite

Currently, the boats are struggling to return to the national elite.

These plans were delayed for at least a year, as in the previous games, being one of the favorites, they failed to advance to the backroom of the extra-class.

In connection with this failure in the summer, there was a club for the staff of the revolution.

The authorities have changed, eventually put on coach Marcin Kaczmarka, and in doing the next step in the top of the club hierarchy, they are supposed to help the leagues of Marcin Robak and Mateusz Możdżer.

For now, Widzew is fourth in the league table II, but in the Polish Cup, he beat the vice-leader of the Silesian University of Silesia at 2: 0 on Tuesday.

Legia, in the same size, narrowed it down on the exit of the Niepołomice Desert.

Extraclass take-off

The only pair made up of representatives of the highest class in the 1/16 finals make up its beniaminek ŁKS and Górnik Zabrze.

The matches of this phase will be held from 29 to 31 October.

This year, the 1/8 finals have been scheduled to be played (3-5 December).

The finale is scheduled to take place on 2 May at the PGE Narodowy in Warsaw.

"Nancy Pelosi: William Barr" "rebellious" "and an impeachment investigation must be rolling in his track"

We never know where we are going.

"Now, in my opinion, we are participating in an attempt to hide the facts of trying to conceal the facts, and the investigation into this case may take," "said Pelosi in an interview with CNN on the Hill of the Capitole."

"" "They do the work they have started, holding on to the facts and the time necessary to find them," "she added."

A protocol released this week by the White House follows that Trump has asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zielenski to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, the candidate of the 2020 Games, and his son.

Trump has also asked Zelenski to work on this matter with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, according to the protocol.

Trump has denied that he has done anything wrong.

On Thursday, CNN reported that the lawyers for the National security from the Department of Justice has notified the signaling complaint of Trump's proceedings involving Ukraine more than a week before the formal notification.

After receiving a complaint as filing from officials from the Intelligence Community, the Department of Justice found that Trump's phone conversation did not provide a criminal investigation into campaign financing.

Asked if Barr should testify, Pelosi stated that on Friday the Intelligence Committee would decide who to call for the witness.

"She added, however, that Barr's view had" "rebelled" "."

This has been a long time.

"" "After all," "(Barra) mentions in all this," "added Pelosi, referring to Trump's mention of his attorney general during the July talks with Ukraine's leader."

It's interesting that he made decisions on how to deal with the complaint.

"Pelosi stated that he was" "very afraid" "about the signaling informants, whom Trump attacked on Thursday as spies, suggesting that he had otherwise acted differently with spies in the past."

I think that the President's words go beyond the irresponsibility, it's dangerous.

"Our signatories play an important role in discovering-revealing offenses in our government" ", stated Pelosi, adding" "President's words concerning persons who can provide information signaling seriously undermine integrity in government" "."

On Tuesday, Pelosi made a historic step of announcing a formal investigation into committing an unlawful act based on allegations of attempts to exert pressure on the leader of a foreign state in order to gain political gain.

"The telephone conversation included a complaint published on Thursday, in which the signal claimed that Trump had abused his power to" "urge Ukraine to interfere" "during the upcoming 2020 elections."

The signal also put the allegation that White House lawyers told officials to remove the transcript of a conversation from a computer system where it is stored for the needs of officials of the Cabinet of Ministers, and put it in a system dedicated to sensitive information.

Ghana: Kofi Manu alarmed by the structure of the Verification Commission

Kofi Manu, a football manager and club representative for Sekondi Hasaacas, raised doubts about the composition of the Verification Commission for the upcoming elections to the National Football Association of Ghana (GFA).

He questioned the inclusion of the President of the Commission, Frank Davies, adding that he was not satisfied with his participation.

In an interview with GNA Sport Manu he expressed doubts as to whether the President of the Commission would be fair, as the outcome of the verification process was in his / her interest.

The verification committee should consist of neutral outsiders who do not show links with any of the members and who have not previously shown any interest.

For example, Davies hired NC as a lawyer who wrote to the Osei Kwaku Palmer in terms of payment of 10 percent.

He is also a well-known supporter of the Olympic Games.

"For these two reasons, it should not be allowed to take a position in the verification committee, because it has an interest in it," "he claimed."

Manu stated that if Fred Pappoe, the Director of the Olympic Games before the Commission, had a conflict of interest on the part of the President due to his association with the club, he suggested at the same time that, if before the State of Palmer , he would be subject to prejudice and bias.

As expected, the members of the Commission were due to start work since yesterday, after being sworn in during a ceremony at the GFA Secretariat in Accra on Tuesday, September 19, and to end them on October 4.

The President of the Commission is Frank Davies, and its members are members of the Consultant. corporate governance and the lawyer of Ms Marian Barnor and Mr. Emmanuel Darkwah.

Israel: There is no agreement on the unity government

Israel's two main parties, the Blue-White and Likud alliance, continued on Friday to negotiate the appointment of a unity government.

The meeting, which was held after the President's trustee of the mission to form the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, did not bring the results.

"The talks were considering the possibility of the rotating presidency of both parties in the government and remaining Netanyahu at the prime minister's position, but-as the Israeli newspaper" "Haarec" "writes-there has not been a rapprochement of views."

The talks will resume on Sunday.

The center-right of the Blue-White Alliance informed in the communion that he presented the initial demands.

"He accuses the right-wing Likud of being" "hoisted in his positions" ", demanding that his leader and former prime minister, Netanyahu, remain at the head of the government, and in the composition of the cabinet-which is a part of his ultra-Orthodox politicians. "

"" "From the very beginning, it was known that the Blue-White did not agree to these conditions," "the message posted by them."

"The likud, acting solely in the interests of Netanyahu, wants to" "bring Israel into the second round of elections" "."

Blue-White leader Benny Gantz refuses to support the government led by Netanyahu as long as he is charged with accusations of involvement in three corruption scandals under which the prosecutor's office could formally prosecute him after the meeting set for Wednesday.

"" "Likud and Blue-Biali had a sufficient majority in the elections on 17 September that would allow them to be shared by common governments as natural allies, but that it would force them to negotiate which neither of the parties wanted," "the EFE agency writes. "

"President Reuwen Riwlin tried to bring their positions closer in the last few days and proposed the appointment of a" "rotating government" ", suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspend his duties, which would allow Gantz to take this position if the accusations against Netanyahu were upheld and formalised. "

There are no shortage of Israeli analysts who think things are stuck in a blind alley.

However, half of the Israelis, according to the poll, whose results published public television on Friday, would like to unblock the political situation in the country by calling a unity government under the rotating presidency of the Netanyahu and Gantz transition.

The solution stands for 50.6 percent. Israelis, 32.1 percent of respondents oppose such a solution.

The poll shows a deep division in Israeli society-to the question of who should be the first to stand at the head of the cabinet, 41.8 percent of respondents are in favor of Netanyahu, and 40 percent behind Gantz.

"In another poll published by the" "Israel Hajom" "newspaper, the percentage of supporters of the unity government is rising to 63 percent, 60 percent are opposed to the new elections that would be third this year."

In the early parliamentary elections on 17 September, he won the Gantz alliance, winning 33 mandates in the 120-seat Knesset, Likud Netanyahu won 32 mandates.

Netanyahu with his traditional and potential allies can count on the support of 55 deputies, while Gantz-on 54.

None of the parties gathered 61 mandates, which were necessary to obtain a majority.

Tipuric calls for fight before final match with Australians

"Justin Tipuric says" "it's time to check on" "when Wales are facing a final showdown with Australia in a World Cup qualifying game that could shape their fate in the tournament."

"Wales' victory over" "kangaroos" "would set this team on the position of a certain favorite to win Group D and guarantee themselves the participation in a likely quarter-final meeting with France or Argentina."

However, if Australia beat Wales for the 14th time. in the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be swiftly sent off for a clash with England in a one-eighth final.

"" "Let's make it clear, both teams want to try it through it and find themselves at the head of the group," "said the Welsh Tipuric rker."

In the past there have been some difficult results, but last autumn it was nice with them (Australia) to win.

I think they will be eagerously trying to take away from us this victory, and we want to be able to address them again.

Before we came here, you knew it was going to be a big start.

And now we're here, and that's really the time to check out.

"Wales had only one win over Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in World Cup history-and it was 32 years ago in the match for third place when they defeated the" "kangaroos" "."

And their total record under the lead coach Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to beat three heavyweight teams from the Southern Hemisphere.

Wales hauled a string of thirteen lost test matches at the hands of Australia last November, and Tipuric prepared to be among those few survivors of that winning 9-6, who will run out at a stadium in Tokyo on Sunday.

"Tipuric questioned whether or not before that victory the team experienced a mental blockade, he added:" "It's hard to say."

These matches are so compensated that maybe ... people expect a certain mental blockade to happen, I don't know.

The end of the finish in the last match probably left on the pitch about 15 points, so the final result looks a lot less advantage than it actually was.

If Wales triumphed, then Tipurica's fight with the beloved Australian duo from the third line of the mill Michael Hooper and David Pocock during detention and flooding will be crucial.

Tipuric has played 67 meetings in the colors of the team and has met both players on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what awaits him.

"" "It's players playing at the position of seventh absolutely world-class," "he said."

When you play against the world-class players of the third mill line, you always know that you will play a difficult game to play.

These two constantly perform with the best riders in the world.

You know what kind of game you can expect.

Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is a more attacking seven and probably better feel rugby, because he's always in the right place at the right time.

It is better to play against the best players in the world and face challenges than to face the third line of the mill, which is not so good.

It's worth playing against the best, and struggling with the two, you definitely need to be in peak form.

I wouldn't say there will be almost a cup final on Sunday, but for us it's an important match in this World Cup.

The impetus is an important element of this.

When we build strength and constantly put in great effort, we will fly like in the wings and we will be hard to beat.

Book Prime Minister.

Waffen-SS Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Młynarczyk

"They were supposed to be the elite organization of the" "race of lords." ""

They took them in the ranks of the ones they despised.

Can a crime combine stronger than a national identity?

In your hands, we are giving away not yet another book on war or military.

We dedicate a deep international study on the participation of non-Germans in the Waffen-SS.

Historians from various countries of Europe analysis attinities and motivations of volunteers, remind them of their activities and look at recruitment processes at the various stages of the war.

Did the Danish troops differ from the French?

Where did the Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?

Why didn't we manage to create a branch of the Poles themselves?

What is the official historical narrative about collaborations in the various European countries today?

What was going on with volunteers after the war ended?

"Among other things, these questions correspond to the book" "Waffen-SS" "based on solid research material."

We sought to present a subtle and more balanced, closer truth to the image of collaborations in Europe during the Second World War, in an attempt to also break the methodological boundaries of historiography and the given period of history through the presentation of the crackdowns by researchers from different countries. (...) As far as the fate of the main victims of this war-forced laborers, Jews, POWs, political opponents of Nazi Germany, the Slavic population-are sometimes presented in comparative and / or supranational terms, the perpetrators are generally examined from a national perspective (as far as that is done).

"" "Totalna panika" "when the White House is struggling to find arguments in the impeachment case"

"Officials from the White House have been shamelessly thinking how to repel the renewed impeachment pressure on Thursday, and one of the interlocutors familiar with the situation describes a sense of" "total panic" "felt last week due to a lack of a response plan for the new reality. "

"It seems to increase" "anxiety, uncertainties and fears" "- one of the people associated with the White House describes the mood in the Western wing-that the informant's allegations could seriously harm the president and people from his surroundings."

"The person stated:" "There is no great certainty that there is nothing in place there." ""

"White House officials were still uncertain about how to proceed, not least because there is no obvious plan of action in such a situation, but also because the allegations are severe enough that the standard methods of effectively avoiding controversy used by the president in the past may not work. "" It doesn't look like something that will pass along with the advent of the next series of news headlines "" - the person joked. "

"Another person knowing the course of the discussion described the atmosphere prevailing in the White House as a" "state of shock" ", accompanied by the increasing distrust that, with the stalemate investigation into the impeachment, it increases the likelihood that the president will respond irresponsible and become "" difficult to master "". "

"This concern is shared by another interlocutor saying that those in the president's environment are predicting that he will show more" "kidnapping" "behavior, and that the pressure exerted on him will certainly begin to increase with every day of the impeachment investigation."

This causes concern that Trump can present increasingly unpredictable behavior and unexpectedly erupt-this is in the context of an election year feared both from the point of view of the presidency as well as the elections.

Facing the biggest threat so far in the presidency, Trump has been circling the attack to defend himself, again reaching for a strategy he assessed as an effective one during Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia.

He tried to downplay his own request to the Ukrainian president for help in an investigation into his political rivals to distract and divert it to the actions of the Democrats and Democratic candidate Joe Biden, and to discredit the whistle as a leading party pobudgist.

"But while a lot of people in the White House are being treated in the battle after Mueller's investigation, this time something has changed," "said the advisers and consultants."

"The president, whose hallmark is the strength, the Wednesday press conference showed as defeated," "declared one of the people familiar with the situation."

"While Trump enthusiastically received questions about the Russian investigation, he seemed not to have the desire to answer questions about Ukraine," "they said."

Some of the president's allies believe that damage can be avoided, and some of them are holding onto the fact that the whistle did not have first-hand knowledge of the aforementioned controversial phone conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zełenski-which they say undermines his credibility.

And as is often the case when the president is the object of the attacks, the fact is live-raised by his main supporters in his defense.

But one of the Republican strategists associated with the White House indicates that the results of the support polls for the president are unbootically high, and the impeachment will not affect very much for the acquisition of new sympathizers.

"" "There is no positive position in the need to focus on the president's impeachment in the next four months," "especially if it makes it harder for his legislative program and prevays in the new series of news headlines."

Another interlocutor says that those who maintained that the impeachment would help the president, did not fully understand how unpredictable his reaction would be.

Troubled White House officials were looking for help with advisers, completing an impeachment response team.

According to a person with knowledge of the plans, taking into account that these efforts are in the early stages, it is unclear whether any initiative in the style of the command center will be taken and what form it can take.

This person has stated that a coordinated legal and communication strategy with a strong leader capable of conducting a PR attack on the publication of a virulent signal report is required and intended to halt the momentum of the impeachment of the democrats given by the disclosure of this report .

The interlocutor familiar with the situation maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly visible when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin stated that they had no intention of divulsing the memo describing Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president, and then 48 hours later, one could feel that there was no way out and a document must be published.

It is expected that now the pressure will be greater than in the course of Robert Mueller's investigation, which usually kept silent, and spoke only through accusations. One of the people to be involved in the development of the impeachment response is Corey Lewandowski, the man from Trump's dirty work and the former Chief of Staff of the Electoral Staff-declared the person involved with the case.

However, Lewandowski said in a conversation with NBC News that he was not truthfully suggesting that he would be directing this action.

"" "For the last five years I have done everything I could to support the president and his program," "he said-but I was not taking part in any talks with the president or his team about joining the team to repel a false narrative concerning impeachment. "" "

Donald Trump's private attorney from Mueller's investigation, Jay Sekulow, also remains committed to the impeachment efforts.

"" "We are responding to matters like it belongs" "- Sekulow responded when he was asked by NBC News to comment."

Currently, the White House is feeling the lack of a lawyer experienced in the field of impeachment, after Emmet Flood, who worked at Clinton's impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, passed away, and the current adviser, Pat Cipollone , does not have this type of experience.

A caller familiar with the White House strategy stated that, in general, officials at no time planned to involve people or form a command center, but acknowledged that the need for a coordinated, joint response and a person could lead a political struggle.

Cruise liner Explorer of the Seas line Royal Caribbean has undergone a refurbishment for £ 89 million

Explorer of the Seas, belonging to the Royal Caribbean International family, will travel this summer on a cruise, presenting a completely new look.

After the renewal, which has claimed an impressive $ 110 million (89 million pounds), the vessel enchants a wide selection of culinary delics from all over the world and a rich offer of entertainment for the whole family.

This summer, the Explorer will stop at the most magnificent ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to feel the taste of Mediterranean Europe.

When the onshore adventure comes to an end, the ship's crew promises unforgettable impressions at sea.

With an offer to satisfy everyone, Explorer, after a renovation of $ 110 million, or about 89 million pounds, has been converted into a passenger ship providing excellent entertainment for the whole family.

The impressive technology means that passengers can surf on board thanks to advanced surf simulators or watch a favorite family movie, taking advantage of the weather charms, within the outdoor cinema.

However, the most revolutionary attraction is the addition of virtual balconies, which allow the cabin passengers to admire the views of the ocean without the need to come on board.

Water enthusiasts will be delighted to be boarded by a pool connecting the Caribbean-style resort with the charms of the water park.

The swimming pool surrounds the beach hammocks and sun loungers perfect for the sun lounging, and two modernized slides are within the reach of the hand of those thirsty for the powerful impressions on board.

"Devin Nunes accuses the Democrats of demanding" "nude photos of Trump" ""

Congressman Devin Nunes of the state of California evidently can't stand the naked truth about the fact that Republican presidential hopping on President Donald Trump is investigating.

In his Thursday defense of the president, he accused Democrats of wanting to receive nude photos of the president.

Nunes, a high-ranking Republican in charge of the Committee on the The House of Representatives' interview made the above allegation during a preliminary statement during the hearing as a result of a signaling complaint that Trump had asked Ukraine for help in the opening of an investigation against Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.

"The congressman called the Ukrainian scandal a" "grotesque depiction" "of the left and their" "medial ace" "before it stated that Democrats wanted to see the president's pictures of the neglivities."

"" "The Democrats in this very committee were negotiating with people who, according to them, were Ukrainians, to receive nude photos of Trump," "said Nunes."

"" "People can rightly ask why the Democrats are so determined to put the president in a state of accusation once they have their chance in a year's time."

When Nunes finished giving reprimends, the political reporter for the HuffPost website, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats were really trying to ... uncover it.

So far, he has only replied to the representative of Connecticut, Jim Himes, although we suspect that his answer is a nude truth, a confirmation of the thoughts of many of his fellow Members.

"Portal Mediaite.com suspects Nunesa's comments about the nudity referred to" "some more lewd and unconfirmed information" "likely to appear in the controversial Steele file,"

It is a weakened, collected by former British spy Christopher Steele's collection of charges against Trump, indicating the likelihood of the existence of a tape that suppress shows him watching handily urging prostitutes in a Moscow hotel room.

Potential research on renewable biofuels can help lower emissions

While electric cars and Semi Tesla have dominated information sites in recent years, one issue seems to be leaking renewable energy-planes.

However, a professor at the University of Alberta has developed a technology whereby renewable biofuels will be able to be used as aviation fuel.

Dr David Bressler is a professor at the University of Alberta at the Faculty of Agriculture, Life Sciences and the Environment, who started working on this project in 2003.

His laboratory is developing hydrocarbon fuel obtained from fat waste such as fat from restaurants, animal origin fats and rapeseed oil.

In contrast to ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can benefit from lower quality oils during production, with an estimate of up to 85% of lower carbon emissions than in the case of oil fuels, as well as waste from other industries in the process.

This technology is tasked with imitating hydrocarbons present in the oil fuel.

"" "What our first-generation technology has done-said Bressler-is [a total of the creation of] hydrocarbons, which are identical molecules as in diesel fuel." ""

While it opens up the new possibility of using biofuels, previously developed biofuel products have had a tendency to destabilize at lower temperatures, which in the case of planes flying at high altitudes was a serious threat.

"" "The problem with the air fuel is a bit of a vicious circle," "said Bressler."

It's actually less worth it than diesel, but it has higher demands.

The Bresslera laboratory is currently looking at two options for producing aviation biofuel.

The first option is a low risk approach, which requires additional treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels and hydrogen addition.

The second option is to continue working on partially developed chemical properties, which will provide fuel stability, even at low temperatures.

"" "We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change it a little bit," "said Bressler, commenting on the second option."

This option is more risky.

A spin-off company established by the University of Alberta, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working on commercialization of the product, as airlines, as well as the Canadian and American armies, increase investment in the renewable option.

"" "They are able to imagine the times in which a reversal of the situation can occur and a carbon tax will be imposed on them," "he said."

Instead, they want an alternative that will be a contingency plan.

Currently, Forge is running a pilot plant near the Waste Management Center in Edmonton and has recently received a $ 4 million sum from Lockheed Martin as part of an investment aimed at supporting a $ 25 million construction of a production facility that will be located in Sombra, Ontario .

The plant is expected to produce about 19 million liters of biofuel per year.

Bressler also notes that the assumed carbon reduction will be about 85 percent, but issues such as transport and fuel production will deteriorate further carbon reduction.

"" "As a technology specialist," "said Bressler-"

"I have for the task to develop options that enable informed decisions and many choices." ""

ORDER: Another deception on the granddaughter

8,000 Zlotys and 750 euros lost the Zamość apartment, thinking it was helping his grandson, who caused the accident.

The police of the incident reported on Thursday the son of a frauduld zamość.

"" "To a woman called Wednesday a man lining up for her grandson."

He told me that he caused an accident and he needs money.

Otherwise he will go to prison.

"A seniorist who wanted to help the grandson gave him 8,000. A total of 750 euros and a fake police officer who came to her house" ", reports asp. Dorota Krukowska-Bubiło from the Zamojska Police Department."

Police officers are looking for the perpetrator and once again call for caution:

"" "Every call for financial assistance should be verified."

You should not act under the influence of emotion and in a hurry.

Let us remember that the cops don't ask for money and they don't take money.

If we receive a call asking for financial support, which will raise our suspicias, you should react immediately and notify the Police by calling the emergency number 112.

We also appeal to younger family members.

Let's talk to our seniors about the threats, let us know how fraudsters work.

"Let us ask you to be careful and not to trust the people who call and ask for the loan." ""

Prime Minister Boris Johnson's allies warn that in the event of the withdrawal of the UK's Brexit, they are threatening to redeem the United Kingdom as in Los Angeles, and he is appealing for calm

"One of the chief cabinet ministers said yesterday evening that the country is threatening a" "violent social rite" "if the original result is challenged by the outcome of the second referendum."

"The British prime minister's allies with his immediate surroundings have warned that the country is threatening social unrest on the scale of the" "yellow vests" "protests in France due to social inequalities and riots in Los Angeles in 1992."

"Johnson called for" "calm sentiment" "during a tumultuous argument over the language of politics, but stressed that it would not stop using the word" "surrender" "."

"Despite his calls for calm, the cabinet minister told the Times:" "There have never been such protests in this country as the demonstrations of" "gilets jaunes" "(" "yellow vests" ") or riots in Los Angeles in 1992 . "

People think it's impossible, just because they didn't happen before.

Now they have the example-gilets jaunes-they use encrypted phones, through which they can coordinate the picket, and to push people to protest is enough of a few unsymphony populist leaders.

The riots in Los Angeles erupted after a grand jury acquitted four white police officers who beat the black taxi driver Rodney King in 1992.

This year, anti-government demonstrators in France wearing yellow reflective vests-a gilet jaunes-have been pupiling and devastating the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.

"The minister referred to Johnson's warning speech in the House of Commons and said that if Britain failed to exit the EU, there would be a" "catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system" "."

"" "If we organize a referendum in which 30 million people will vote, and 66 percent of them opt for Britain staying in the European Union, the dissatisfied will remain ten million citizens," "the ministry said."

Even if such a result ignores 99% of them, and so we will have 100,000 angry people who will write to their fellow Member and who will not let go.

Many do not need to see dozens of thousands of people in the street.

"One of the chief cabinet ministers added that the country is threatening a" "violent social rite" "if the outcome of the first referendum is challenged by the outcome of the other."

Johnson called for an organized general election in which voters would settle the fate of the Brexit.

According to reports, the prime minister faces the risk of a cabinet rebellion wanting to lower demands in relation to brexit and to achieve a compromise agreement with the EU.

Hołownia, Czubówna and Krosny have been preserved in Krakow.

Behind us Talk 'N' Roll

More than 300 participants heard on Thursday (26 September) 11 inspiring speeches by speakers, among others Szymon Hołownia, Krystyna Czubówna or Ireneusz Krosny.

This is all in the framework of the Talk 'N' Roll conference, which was held in Krakow for the fifth time.

Talc 'N' Roll 2019

Broadening the horizons, conversations about ideas worth speaking, and joint discussions that can become an impulse for further development.

This goal was to bring together the organizers of the Talk 'N' Roll conference, inviting to the stage 11 exceptional speakers, representing very diverse industries and areas of interest, and among them among other people familiar with the media-Szymon Hołownia, Krystyna Czubówna and Ireneusz Krosnego.

"The motto of this year's edition of Talk 'N' Roll was" "Crafting the future, NOW" "and just around the creation of the future focused on the speeches of guests invited to attend the conference."

The first session opened the Managing Director of Saber Polska, Sebastian Drzewiecki, who told about how the brand he builds around himself could have an impact on our future.

Richard Lucas went on stage to change the audience's perception of the phenomenon of rejection, arguing that they should be accepted if they wanted to create a future, and Chris Badura took the subject of empathy at the time of the rapid development of technology.

Paula Mascarenhas (VP ​​Saber) shared insights and techniques that can help manage careers and increase overall satisfaction by finding the right balance between professional and private life.

The second part of the conference opened a multi-threaded conversation with Krystyna Czubówna, who talked about, among other things, how from her perspective over the years he was changing the profession of reading in Poland.

The holder of one of the most popular voices in the country has acknowledged that, thanks to the development of technology, today everyone can make the profession more difficult for them.

However, he does not think that, in the coming years, a man in his post is completely replaced by technology.

"Just after her, Piotr Nabielec took the problem of life in an information overload, emotional, or overload of choice, giving the audience valuable tips on how to deal with it, and Łukasz Łętocha in his speech talked about what another industrial revolution could lead to, known as "" Industry 4.0 "". "

Playing with teaching, teaching play

The organizers of the conference also took care of the artistic impression, inviting to the stage of the illusionist, Daniel Jeducka.

The third part of the conference opened Ireneusz Krosny, who first played the audience with the pantonimum, and then-on the example of his own career-he told about how he strives to maintain the right balance between career on stage and private life.

Szymon Hołownia also kidnapped participants in his speech, emphasizing the role of the time in our lives.

The publicist pointed out that even two minutes can diametrically change the situation and you have to be ready to use this time.

In addition, Hołownia shared his thoughts on the reality surrounding us, recalling anecdotes that could have caused a smile on the faces of the spectators.

Then on stage came Adrian Creator, who reviewed the history and objectives of several models of innovation and referred them to the way they are being used nowadays.

At the end of Marcin Słowiak, on the example of Rubik's cube, he told about the approach to solving problems.

Each of the 11 speakers certainly contributed something new to the perception of the reality of everyone who had the opportunity to watch the performances, and the natural reactions and numerous questions to the guests testify to the big commitment from the audience.

The organizers provided a broadcast for everyone who could not personally attend the event, and the prelesson recordings are available on the website.

Rule of law instead of rule of law.

"" "Despite the lack of sufficient votes to change the Constitution, the ruling majority has introduced a number of changes to the state system, creating threats to protect the rule of law and the principle of tridivision of powers," "writes the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights in a report published on Thursday. "

The report 'Rule of law instead of the rule of law' documents, among other things, changes in the judiciary and in the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.

"The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) published a report on Thursday entitled" "Governments instead of the rule of law."

"Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland in the years 2015 -2019" "."

The Foundation assesses in the report that in 2015-2019 the greatest regress was recorded in the protection of human rights in Poland after 1989.

"" "Despite the lack of enough votes to change the Constitution, the ruling majority has introduced a number of changes to the state system, creating threats to protect the rule of law and the rule of tridivision of power."

"By adapting the right to political ends, the rule of law has been replaced by the rule of law," "the HFPC experts write."

What is the HFPC report?

The report documents changes in the functioning of the judiciary, independent institutions (such as the public media or the Ombudsman) and in the sphere of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, LGBT rights and the right to a fair trial).

The report also summarizes the dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union for three years.

"" "Over the last four years for the first time and on such a scale we have observed the use of the right to carry out the party's partisan interests."

"This translated into the ongoing crisis of the rule of law, as well as the weakening of the whole system of protection of human rights in Poland" ", stressed the attorney Marcin Free, one of the report's authors."

Protection of human rights

"As indicated in the report, the last four years are" "a period of systemic change both in the state" "and" "in terms of the protection of human rights" "."

Over the last four years, the Sejm has adopted more than 20 legal acts from the point of view of the protection of human rights.

"" "The changes were often adopted at a hasty pace, without social consultations and despite the reservations of legal circles, the Ombudsman or international organizations," "explained the lawyer of Małgorzata Szuleka, co-author of the report."

"According to the report, the main tendencies observed over the last four years are:" "weakening independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), not making binding judgments of the courts and recommendations of international institutions, and weakening the guarantee of the protection of human rights "". "

The authorities of the State did not react

"In particular, the disturbing Helsinki Foundation for Human Affairs considered" "those situations in which the organs of the State did not respond or outright disregard the emergent cases of aggression" "."

Foundation experts noted that some changes were introduced in the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or occupational groups or groups exposed to discrimination.

The Foundation points out that the result of the state's activity in the field of limiting the rule of law is the ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities with the European Union, and a number of recommendations from the entities of international law.

"" "The lack of implementation of these recommendations does not only weaken Poland's position as a leader of democratic transformations in the CEE region, but also exposes the Polish state to the responsibility of violating European Union law or the European Convention on Human Rights," "the report reads."

Brother of Pakistani social media star with life imprisonment for honor killing

Experts on women's rights claim that the investigation of justice is often due to protracted proceedings, releasing suspected killers on bail and blurring cases in public awareness.

"" "It is going on so long that people forget," "says Farzana Bari, the women's rights defender and founder of the first in Pakistan's gender studies department at the university, and adds that even the widely publicized case of Baloch's murder has been decided for more than three years. "

Although, according to groups fighting for women's rights, reliable data is difficult to establish, the Pakistani committee on human rights in 2018 has found at least 300 cases of so called. of honor killings.

Many activists say that the actual number is much higher, and the network promoting awareness of honor crimes estimates that there are about a fifth of the 5,000 honor killings in Pakistan every year around the world.

Record earnings of Poles abroad

"However, the transfers to the country are diminish, because many emigrants gather outside Poland permanently-says" "Rzeczpospolita" "on Friday."

According to the latest report from Euro-Tax, the average earnings of Poles working in other countries in Europe amounted to 2018. over 8,6 thousand. PLN, which means that they have increased almost by a thousand zlotys, or almost 12 percent.

"Euro-Tax" "estimates that the total income of Polish economic emigrants in the Union countries reached in 2018. A record value of 154.5 billion zł, one seventh more than a year before," "the statement reads."

Director of the Center for Research on Migrations of the University of Warsaw, Paweł Kaczmarczyk says that Poles are getting better and better off on the international labor market, where they use various available options.

"" "There is also a growing number of specialists and professionals who, in search of more and better conditions, are moving from country to country, as are the employees of multinational corporations" ", reports the newspaper."

A part of Euro-Taxu clients per year works in two countries, eg. United Kingdom and Germany.

"" "It's in the RFN in 2018. The most, by 11%, increased the total earnings of Polish emigrants (to nearly PLN 27 billion)."

"However, and as much as they have earned the Poles in the Islands-almost 35 billion PLN," "we read further."

The President of Euro-Taxu believes that, despite the improvement of working conditions on the Polish market, the number of economic emigrants does not decrease.

Still the sacsa in the West and the north of Europe (at the head of Norway) is often a chance for several times higher wages than in Poland.

"" "And that's even at the minimum rates in a given country, which, for example, In Germany, they amount to 9.5-11.7 euros per hour," "the newspaper reports."

"" "Rzeczpospolita" "reports that Poles stay not only because of higher wages, but also because they have been deposed abroad."

Many Poles forgo abroad roots, as can be seen in the declining remittans of money to the country.

These last year's were the lowest for years.

As the economist Tadeusz Chrościcki recalls, with the extension of the period of residence abroad, a group of people transferring money to the country is declining and their height decreases.

"" "The Emigrants bring their loved ones to each other," "reads the" "Rzeczpospolita" "on Friday."

Prolonged monsuns cause floods and chaos in many regions of India

The monsoon season in India has been extended for nearly a month, and unprecedented rainfall is causing death as a result of the landslides and rotting of many crops.

Usually in northern India, monsoon surges in early September, however, average rainfall this month exceeded the norm by 37%.

According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be the latest ending of the monsoon for decades.

In many areas of the country, rainfall is still unprecedented-in recent times in the west Indian city of Pune Wednesday and Thursday torrential rain led to the death of a dozen or so people and the devastation caused by the collapse of buildings.

There was a flooding of houses, people got through the streets in the water to their knees, which normally takes place only during the apogee of the monsoon.

Heavy rainfall occurred also in such cities as Kolkata, Lucknow and Hajdarabad.

As a result of prolonged rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand many houses were destroyed.

Monsun also began with a delay.

There was a shortage of water in many areas, so farmers were preparing for a probable drought.

For too long an ongoing monsoon is not welcome by farmers.

Such a quantity of rain is not something normal at this time of year.

"" "Through him my vegetables-and I have now a cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes-they rot," "says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand state."

For consumers, the impact of the delayed, and also late-ending monsoon means a raise in the price of the onion, or an unodzable ingredient in Indian dishes.

The onion, for which it was usually necessary to pay 20 rupees (0.23 British pound), now costs 80 rupees (approx. 1 pound British pound) per kilogram in cities like Delhi and Mumbai.

Festivals and holidays are also at stake.

"Another big festival is the 8 October Dasara holiday, during which the Indians raise huge cock as from the comic, depicting Ravana, a figure of a lush mustache and a sinister smile from the epic" "Ramayana" "."

The burning of Ravana symbolizes the triumph of the good over evil.

However, given that the Ravana sub-chambers were made of paper, if the monsoon continues, Ravana will be laughing at the last one.

Doodle celebrates Google's 21st birthday

It would be hard to imagine a world without Google today.

In the search engine we are looking for answers to all the questions that have been tormented.

What are we looking for in Google?

"" "What is this?" "," "Where?" "," "How?" "And" "How many?" "Are some of the favorite categories searched by the Poles."

"According to the giant's data, last year we were happy to ask, among other things," "Where is the storm?" "," "How do I do asparagus?" "And" "How many fingers is a horse?" "," "How do you get rid of fruit flies?" "," "How do I eat kaki?" "."

Today's search engine celebrates the twenty-first birthday today.

"Its users-and in Poland as many as 96% of people are using" "Google's uncle" "- this is the special Google Doodle today."

This time it is not animated.

Google is reminiscent of its birthdays, showing a stationary computer with a monitor, a mouse and a keyboard, and in the right, bottom corner printed a digital date-as in the picture of the 1990s.

Cataloging information

The search engine was created for a specific purpose-it was to catalog all possible information and share it with the Internet.

Its name is a word game.

It comes from a mathematical term googol, meaning the number of ten raised to the centenary power.

This name was also intended to reflect the intention of the company to index as many pages as possible from the world's Internet resources.

Google's search engine was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.

It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationships between the parties, which worked better than the methods of ordinary segregation of results based on the frequency of occurrence of the given phrase.

At the beginning, the search engine was called BlackRub, which refers to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages that link to the result.

Page and Brin founded Google Inc. on September 7, 1998, and soon after, they launched the famous google.com website.

What's next, Google?

"In December 1998, the" "PC Magazine" "appears to have an extremely high accuracy of Google's search results."

Then the company's history looks almost like a fairy tale-instant development with every month, conquer the next markets and increase the value of the company.

Already in June 2000, Google's URL index has more than a billion items, making the work of Page and Brin gaining the name of the largest Internet search engine in the world.

Currently, the company founded by Page and Brina is one of the leading players in the IT market.

Is there any further field to develop?

"" "Google's mission is to organize global information resources to be widely available and useful, even though we have made great strides in this area, it is ahead of us yet a very long way to achieve this goal," "he assured in a conversation with "" Newsweek "" Piotr Zalewski of Google Poland. "

Frequent contact with pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke

A new study suggests that working with exposure to plant protection products in a high concentration may translate into a high risk of heart ailments in later years of life.

This is what happened in the case of a group of Americans of Japanese descent in Hawaii, which has been investigated for more than 30 years.

Researchers found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the greatest contact with them were 45 percent more likely to have heart disease or stroke.

"" "This study highlights the need to use personal protective equipment on the time of contact with pesticides at work and the importance of filing in the medical documentation of contact with such means at work, and controlling standard factors for increasing the incidence of heart disease , "" said co-author of the study Dr Beatriz Rodriguez. "

She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the Hawaiian University in the Manoa district.

The results were based on data on more than 6,000 men on the island of Oahu, who took part in the Kuakini Honolulu's cardiology program.

As scientists have pointed out, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations, as it only affected men of Japanese origin.

Pesticides have a long half-life of decay, so the effects of their effects on health may well know a lot of years after coming into contact with these substances.

In this case, the most visible results were observed in 10 years after contact with the plant protection substances.

"In a press release, Rodriguez passed:" "after 34 years of observation of men, it turned out that the link between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant" "."

This was probably due to the fact that it was more important to become factors related to aging, which masked possible causal relations between exposure to pesticides and the incidence of cardiovascular disease in the later years of life.

The researchers did not discover a significant relationship between the exposure to small to moderate quantities of plant protection products and an increase in the risk of heart disease or stroke.

Ze³enski-Trump phone conversation: Poroshenko will throw his three cents

Washington politics has been behind a turbulent week in connection with the initiation of an impeachment procedure against US President Donald Trump

The political scandal entanles the political debut of Volodymyr Ze³enski, a situation he would have preferred to avoid.

But what do we really know about the Zełenski-Trump scandal and whether it will have a far-reaching impact on the first of them?

Almost at the outset of the phone conversation, Trump declared to the Zealese that the United States is doing more for Ukraine than European countries.

Despite the fact that the notes revealed by the White House are not full, they detail Trump's attack on German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the fact that the German leader along with other European countries' leaders engage in negotiations instead of presenting concrete proposals.

The controverses have raised the response of Zełenski, who has announced that he agrees with Trump not 100%, but in 1,000%.

Zelenski added that both French President Macron and Merkel were not enough to try to help Ukraine.

This exchange of opinion has made politicians, especially from the Ukrainian opposition, to decide to take the floor via social media sites.

"Petro Poroshenko, the former president of Ukraine, stated on Twitter that the support provided by the EU" "was without precedent" "."

"In other tweets Poroshenko said he was grateful for granted during the" "Russian aggression" "of EU support, which included sanctions and financial assistance."

"Others expressed their concerns, among others, the Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytsitska announced:" "How can we speak now with Germany and France?" "."

Then Trump mentioned military aid and asked Zelenski to investigate not in one, and two cases: the first concerning the son of Joe Biden-Hunter-and the second relating to the hacking of the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in the hacking attack on the Democrats' email boxes during the 2016 election.

The court unequivocally stated that I was innocent, and I did not violate the law at that time.

I was convinced that my phone conversation at that time with the Marshal of the Podkarpackie Voivodeship was in accordance with the applicable law.

The version of the events that were made public by the media in 2013. by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Lublin passed with the truth and caused irreparable damage to both the trader of the food producer as well as the loss of the image of my person in my employers, among the employees and also in the local community.

The indictment made against me in the opinion of the Court of First Instance contained a number of errors, untrue facts, unreliable terms of the legal bases, not confirmed in the reality of events.

With the help of the CBA in Rzeszow, it was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.

I was then immediately discharged from work and devoid of funds.

According to the investigators, he was in a telephone conversation to tell the then marshal of the voivodship (Mirosław Karapyta was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment) the term of inspection at the plant producing food oil belonging to the wife of the then Deputy Marshal of Podkarpackie .

This warning-as they claimed by the prosecutors of Lublin-was to cause the company's owner to know about the controls and to correct the labels on the oils that were incomplete.

Jerzy Wiśniewski heard allegations of overrun of powers, for which he threatened up to 3 years of imprisonment.

"" "I feel relieved that this case has finally come to an end and the court has confirmed my innocence."

"From the beginning I was convinced that I did not do anything wrong, which now the final confirmation is a final judgment acquitting me from the charges brought to me" ", comments Jerzy Wiśniewski."

The White House sought to hide the transcript of the conversation with the Zełenski

In a redacted report released on Thursday, he wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenski, sought interference with a foreign state in the US election, and the White House sought to hide the transcript of that conversation.

Presidents of Ukraine and the USA

"In an anonymous report dated August 12, the signalled, who is likely an intelligence employee, wrote:" "As part of my official duties, I was informed by many members of the American government that the president was using his function to demand the interference of a foreign country in the 2020 elections in the United States. "" "

"" "Trump has used part of the conversation (of Zelenski) to pursue his own interests."

"And exactly-he tried to push for the Ukrainian leader to take steps that would help the president to re-election in 2020," "the report said, as quoted by the" "The Hill" "newspaper."

"The Ukrainian leader" "has been given an understanding" "that contacts with Trump depend on whether he" "will show the will to take the game" "in matters that he was more specifically told to inform the lawyer of President Rudy Giuliani. "

"The author admits that he has not witnessed the conversation, but stresses that he was specifically informed about her content by" "many White House officials who had direct information about it," "and their relations were overlapping."

"" "In the following days after this conversation I learned from a number of American officials that high-ranking White House officials intervened to 'seal' all the archival records of this conversation, and especially the literal transcript that was drawn up, just as it usually does, in the White House crisis room, "" we read further. "

"" "High-ranking White House officials told me that White House lawyers had" "ordered them" "to delete an electronic record from the IT system where such records are stored."

"The recording has been moved to a separate electronic system, which is typically used to store sensitive information and manipulate them," "wrote the report's author."

"" "In my assessment, these steps bear witness to the fact that White House officials were aware of the importance of what happened during the conversation," "he assessed the signalled."

As the AP news agency says, this document will probably speed up proceedings on the president's possible impeachment, and it also contains valuable information about witnesses who can confirm this relationship.

The transcript of the interview with the Zełenski White House, after the pressure of Congress, made available on Wednesday, however, not on the basis of electronic recording, but based on the relations of the people who witnessed it.

The content of the report, in the redacted version, revealed a day later by the House of Representatives' intelligence committee.

Also on Thursday, acting director of US intelligence Joseph Maguire tested before the House of Representatives intelligence committee and made explanations about the way the intelligence employee's report was treated.

Maguire said the signal had made the right choice and acted as the law dictates.

"He also stressed that in his opinion the issue of the interview with Zelenski is an event" "without precedent" "."

Democrats in the intelligence committee asked Maguire why he blocked the making available to Congress of a signal report; the director of intelligence denied he had no authority to disclose his content, whose confidential nature guarantees the so-called. the privilege of the executive.

Part of Maguire's interrogation by the committee was held behind closed doors.

On Tuesday, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi reported that on suspicion that the president had pressured the Ukrainian authorities to harm his potential rival in the next presidential election, the House of Representatives is launching an investigation that could lead to the impeachment of Trump .

A day later, she assessed that the transcript of Trump's conversation with Zełenski confirms that the US president has broken the standards for election and security.

The US electoral law prohibits the use of aid from foreign states.

"The resort of justice, however, assessed that the president did not break the electoral law. On Thursday, White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said that there was" "nothing wrong" "in the conversation, and in the report" "there is nothing more than a set of third-hand relations and spliced ​​together press cutouts "". "

"" "The White House will continue to criticize this media hysteria and the false narrative propagated by mainstream media," "she added."

Exhibition of the missing Elizabeth I gown at Hampton Court Palace

The silver thread of the gown made from the finest silk camel was articulated with embroidery embroidery, animals, and butterflies.

For Eleri Lynn, curator of the exhibition of the Historic Royal Palaces Foundation, this meant only one thing.

The faded fabric hanging from 100 years on the wall of a tiny village parish church she was looking at could only be a missing part of Elizabeth I's dressing room.

Three years after Lynn stumped on a case for an exhibit of Bacon-based altar fabric in Herefordshire, Elizabeth's missing dress is expected to hit next month for an exhibition at Hampton Court palace, close to the same rooms where the Queen's Tudor dynasty could have worn her more than 450 years ago.

The measure of the significance of this discovery is that of the entire collection of royal dresses, only one element of the 16th-century dress has survived.

While there is no insecure evidence that Elizabeth would ever wear this dress, three years of research have strengthened the experts in the belief that she had to be part of the royal dressing room.

"The" "Srebroheads" ", an incredibly expensive fabric, was legally reserved for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtuoso quality of embroidered plants and flowers, later enriched with deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears, indicates that the clothing belonged to the most exquisite of the people. "

The dress, at the time she was sewn, could have cost the equivalent of the Tudor estate.

"" "What's more, in the 1990s. In the 16th century, at the end of the reign of Elizabeth, she felt a threat from other women at the court and would not tolerate a rivalry wearing such exquisite fabrics," "claims Lynn. "

"" "As this is a very important statement, I have asked many people from the environment to look at the gown."

I was really pleased that seeing the dress, they were also delighted and were practically convinced that we had a royal wardrobe before us.

The long, relife of the gown, trimmed to serve as the altar fabric in the dark church of St Faith in Bacon, is not as unexpected as it might seem.

Bacton is the settlement of Blanche Parry, the nearest woman to Elizabeth of the court, who served the Queen throughout her long life, and with which in the local legends the fabric of the cloth was identified.

Although the dress was created after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth had to donate her to the Parry family or the parish to the memory of Blanche before her death in 1603.

"After more than a thousand hours of conservation work, of which four hundred have passed on the most delicate hand of hand by means of specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles, the altar fabric will go to the exhibition next to the rented exhibition by Hatfield House at the "" Rainbow Portrait "" portrait, one of the most famous images of the time depicting Elizabeth dressed in a similar dress. "

"" "When working with historical fabrics, it starts to really respect the craftsmanship of the people who have done it," "says Libby Thompson, the head of conservation work, a major part of which was held in a greenhouse on the Hampton Court Palace-the only large enough place to accommodate some of the priceless palaces of the gobelins. "

"" "Looking at the embroiream from the front and back, I started to feel a huge respect, for those who did it."

I've never worked on something so elitized.

"Exhibition" "pt." "The Lost Dress of Elizabeth" "will begin on 12 October at Hampton Court Palace"

Fitch agency confirmed Poland's rating with the prospect of stable

"Fitch confirmed on Friday the long-term rating of Poland in foreign currency at the" "A-" "level-stated in the communion."

The rating outlook remained stable.

"" "The Fitch Agency points to the strong macroeconomic fundamentals and a well-diversified economy that is supported by a judicially conducted economic policy and a strong banking sector," "reads the Finance Ministry's message."

As added, Fitch pointed out that Poland found itself at the peak of the business cycle, and in the years 2019-2021 the real growth rate of Gross Domestic Product in Poland will be 4.1 percent, 3.3 percent and 2.9 percent respectively.

The agency forecasts that the general government's deficit to GDP ratio between 2020 and 2021 will remain below the 3 percent limit, 2.3 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively.

"" "The debt ratio of government and self-government sector to GDP in 2019. will be by the agency 50.5 percent, and in subsequent years will be smaller (average 48.3 percent in the period 2020-2021)," "the statement reads . "

Rating of Poland

The autumn round reviews of the Polish rating on 11 October will end with SP and Moody's.

Poland's rating in the assessment of Fitch's agency remains the same as it was released at the end of March 2019.

"At that time, the agency confirmed Poland's rating at the" "A-" "level with the prospect of a stable."

"Of the three largest credit rating agencies, Poland's credit rating is at the highest rating of Moody's-at" "A2" "level."

"The rating of Poland according to Fitch and SP is" "A-" ", one level lower than Moody's."

The perspectives of all the assessments are stable.

What is a rating?

Credit rating agencies shall be set up to assist investors in assessing the risk scale of their investment activities.

The rating is granted to companies, banks and countries.

In the case of the latter, each assessment translates into economic attractiveness.

The rating is nothing more than a credit rating.

It makes decisions about who and how much money is borrowed.

Sometimes such information also suggests to whom it is best not to give any credit at all, because there is a serious risk that the money will not be recovered.

A lower rating is at a higher risk.

In turn, higher risk is high interest on credit.

Each assessment must be justified and argued.

The rating can be manipulated, but in this case, the agencies risk losing their reputation.

At the moment, more than 90 percent of the global market for credit rating services control three agencies: Standard Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.

Each of them uses their own rating system.

The head of a Mexican cartel stands for a third of the drugs in the US

Chicago-just after sunrise on the West Side of Chicago CBS News reported a morning pursuit of drugs.

Brian McKnight from the Office for the The fight against drugs (DEA) in full light showed what was going on.

Last year in Chicago, nearly 800 people died from a drug overdose.

"McKnight claimed" "probably 90%" "of drugs in Chicago came from Mexico."

DEA is focusing on Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantes, known simply as El Mencho.

"" "This is the most important priority for the DEA and directly to the federal executive bodies in the United States," "stated Matthew Donahue, the DEA's main agent in Mexico."

The prize for El Mencho goes back to $ 10 million.

He helped uncover dozens placed in the jungle of El Mencho's drug labs.

Belonging to El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, or CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs reaching the USA by land and sea.

"According to the Department of Justice, the cartel smuggled" "tons" "of cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin contaminated with fentanyl."

The head of El Mencho is facing a reward of $ 10 million.

Ironically, about 30 years ago, he lived in California, where he was arrested on charges related to drugs and eventually deported to Mexico.

That's where he created a brutal cartel.

It's got a huge amount of weapons, RPG, 50-caliber weapons.

"He basically owns his own SWAT teams," "added Donahue."

El Mencho with impunity protects its empire by applying such measures as shooting down a helicopter of the Mexican army, killing six people, or taking part in a public hangover this summer.

In the past years, the brutality of the cartel has led to thousands of murders.

According to the statistics of the Mexican government, there are about 94 murders every day.

Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they can't be dealt with without protective equipment.

In the lab, a package of cocaine means a smuggler's brand.

For more than a third of them, they lead to the El Mencho cartel.

"" "He is responsible for sending poison, which kills innocent women and children," "stated Donahue."

"So when a child dies, according to Donahue, there is a" "big chance" "that the drugs come from the El Mencho organization."

More than 67 000 Americans died from an overdose last year.

France: 27-year-old blackmailed President of France and his wife

The 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the first lady, the French public prosecutor's office said.

The defendant assures him that he has documents that compromising the presidential couple.

The man was subjected to a psychiatric examination, but the doctors did not find any serious disorder in him.

The game PS4 will be oldskulking-Sony reveals surprising facts about PlayStation 4

Sony sheds more light on the debut soon game available exclusively on PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.

Sony as part of the recent State of Play presentation announced that the premiere of the sequel to The Last of Us will take place in February 2020.

Fans could also see a new piece of breathtaking gameplay from the upcoming action game.

Even more concretes were revealed in the days after the high-profile premiere of the showpiece The Last of Us 2.

And it looks like the Sony together with Naughty Dog is reaching for the old-school climbs in many respects.

It's been decided for something we haven't seen in common since the PS 1. The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several tiles.

Neil Druckmann from Naughty Dog confirmed this in a revelatory interview given to The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel has grown into one of the most extensive games in history.

"" "Fabuła is ambitious and intricate in aspects where the one was not," "he said."

She had to be so extensive in order to be able to present this kind of story with the back of characters.

We didn't intend to create the most extensive game, it just happened.

"" "We are excited to be aware of how much opportunities there are in this story. There will be times when you think you're headed towards the end, but you'll realize it's just the beginning and that a completely new chapter starts , "" Druckmann says. "

It's such an ambitious game that it didn't fit on one BluRayu and it's on two tiles.

Elsewhere, it was revealed that The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two easter eggi about the adult content (information given by Gamestpot).

We will not spoilt surprises, but appearing in the game of easter eggi refer to the oldskulate works of Naughty Dog.

You will learn more when The Last of Us: Part Two makes its debut on 21 February 2020. on the PS4 only.

Those with the PS4 can prepare for the premiere of the sequel, reaching for The Last of Us Remastered available in the PS Plus offer.

Sony recently announced a list of free games on the PS4 offered since October 2019. by PlayStation Plus, among which is mentioned above the production of Naughty Dog.

PS Plus subscribers will also have access from October to MLB The Show 19.

If you like The Last of Us Remastered and you want to make a pre-premiere order for the sequel, Sony has reported that there will be a lot of version of the game, including an exclusive edition featuring a replica of Ella's backpack and her bracelet and a 30-inch figurine of that cult character.

Running, jerking and fighting-Sport

On Saturday, the first time Stomil will take Podbeskidzie and feel like a victory.

Stomilu Football from three queues are undefeated.

At that time, Piotr Zajączkowski had won seven points, because they won with Stalna Mielec and Chojniczanka Chojnice, and in the last match, they won a goalless draw in Suwałki.

Now the olsztyn team on Saturday at the hour. 18 will take Podbeskidzie, which is listed as one of the favorites for promotion to Ekstraklasa.

Stomyl's closest rivals occupy the fourth place in the table and have a point of advantage over the team from Olsztyn.

The podbeskidzie for the trips this season has played six times and has resulted in two victories, remissions and defeats, while Stomil feels very well on his own facility-at the stadium at al. Piłsudski 69a team of Piotr Zajączkowski won three times and lost once.

In the top ten, the Olsztyn queues have accumulated 17 points and are at the forefront of the table, although after two defeats at the start of the game, nothing has been announced.

"" "Every change takes time to get results" ", explains Piotr Skiba."

"" "Well, at the end of the time, we got a bit of a tooth, and we believed in ourselves, and we could work under normal conditions."

We just focused on playing the ball.

"They are clean heads, there is a good atmosphere and everyone knows what to do because we have a strong training staff" "."

On Tuesday, the Stomyl footballers eliminated the Chorzów Movement from the Polish Cup, but they needed a round of play and a series of penalty shootings.

Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not go to the south of Poland, because Coach Zajączkowski gave some rest to these key players ahead of Saturday's skirmish with Podbeskidziem.

On the other hand, in Chorzów, he played returning after the injury of Jakub Mosakowski, who finally shot his long-awaited goal.

"" "It's always cool to get a goal, and I've hit it at a time like this, so that we can keep playing in the trophies (Mosakowski equalled 3: 3 in the 119-minute-red)."

"My dad used to make me laugh and laugh that I couldn't score a goal, and I always told him that I would shoot at that point when he wasn't expecting it." ""

Now Mosakowski is counting on a return to the basic lineup, all the more so because of the yellow cards he can't play Otear Tarasenko.

"" "After that, I'm going to keep my eye on training so that I can play the first line-up," "says Mosakowski."

"" "In Chorzów I was doing everything I could to present myself as best."

However, whether I'm going to play or sit on a reserve bench, I'm still going to support the team so much.

Because the most important is the team and three points in the match against Podbeskidziem.

"We are sure to have a hard meeting, in which victory will have to be run out, to emerge and to fight." ""

In the middle of the Olsztyn defense can still play Rafał Remisz, who recently also entertained the injury, so about whether he will perform, we will find out only on Saturday, the more that coach Zajączkowski traditionally until the end of the HR case is trying to keep the secret.

A man raped and murdered a niece.

"" "You will never see the light of day."

"Never again will you breathe fresh air," "said Judge Kevin K. Allen, addressing Alex Whipple."

"" "What you did was so disgusting and despicable that you have to spend the rest of your life in prison," "he added."

The 5-year-old Lizzy disappeared in May.

Her search lasted for five days, until Whipple pointed out a place to hide the body.

"" "How could someone have done their own niece?" ", Asked Dejay Smith, the girl's uncle."

"" "You are the worst person humankind has to offer," "he said to Alex Whipple."

"" "I would give everything to meet her again, to hug," "said the mother of the murdered girl."

"" "Our lives will never be the same again," "she added a devastated woman."

As Fox News reports, the 22-year-old Whipple did not show any emotion during the interrogation.

Last month, he confessed that he had kidnapped, sexually exploited and murdered a girl.

"The man's attorney stated that his client was raised in an" "imperfect family" "."

He was to be molested as a child.

He also added that Whipple is aware that he has committed a terrible act and is willing to incur a penalty.

A man has been sentenced to life imprisonment without being able to apply for parole.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced that he will donate nearly $ 100 million to additional funds to the drought-affected communities.

The program providing money to farmers affected by the drought will be extended and the criteria for the allocation of allowances on farms will be simplified.

The aid package includes nearly $ 34 million for the support initiative for communities affected by the drought, so that eligible holdings can receive up to $ 3,000 in emergencies.

Each of the 13 local local government areas under the aid scheme affected by the drought will receive up to $ 1 million in subsidies for infrastructure and assistance in dealing with the consequences of the disaster.

The new support package is in addition to the more than $ 7 billion earmarked by the government for the drought-fighting fund.

Frostpunk-a strategic game combining the characteristics of a city-builder with a unique simulator of the 19th century society and a frosty survivalry-is approaching the scheduled for the 11th of October premieres on consoles.

11 bit studios made every effort to create a strategic game in which in an intuitive and natural way, you can play with a console controller.

Frostpunk is a game that treats the survival of a society over the edge of a society where warmth means life, and every decision has its own price.

The player's job is to build on the frozen emptiness of the city, whose heart is a steam generator.

Now a comprehensive, strategic gameplay, combined with a rich storyline and unparallyexperienced experience, will be available on consoles.

Frostpunk: Console Edition will be a real test for your tactical knowledge.

Betrayal of the Chinese (In the Name of Love China's Mistress Busters)

Documentary: In China in the last decade the number of divorces has risen twice.

The cause of this condition was generally a third party.

More and more men maintain extramarital relations, which has led to the development of a particular industry in this country-professional slavery lovers, who are tasked with saving the marriage of betrayed wives.

Let's scan loudly: Ma-te-ush!

Attempt to welcome the Prime Minister in Piekary Śląskie

A peculiar general attempt was carried out before the electoral meeting with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Piekarach Śląskie.

"" "Ladies and gentlemen, louder, louder, in this way we will not welcome the Prime Minister here!"

"Let us scan loudly: Ma-te-ush!" ", Encouraged a strong presenter."

Unfortunately, the efforts of the enthusiastic waterfalls did not bring the expected result.

Electoral campaign in progress.

Politicians drive around the country, convincing the voters.

The intensive campaign also leads Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who as the leader of the Silesian PiS list is a frequent visitor in the region.

Each meeting is carefully planned, including the right abattoed.

So it was, or rather, it was supposed to be, in Piekarach Śląskie.

We know-a special guest should be specially greeted.

Prior to the meeting with the Prime Minister, the presenter decided to conduct a general rehearsal.

Like a dry water, he tried to entice the crowd to scandal the name of the head of government.

"" "It will not be a greeting for me, only for the Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki!"

"Also louder, louder my dear ones!" ", Encouraged the enthusiastic."

"Unfortunately, the crowd did not give in to the full kidnapping of the presenter and reluctantly corresponded to" "Ma-te-us" ", but the recording of an enthusiastic watershed makes a furore in the net."

Ronald Lee Haskell: A man convicted of the murder of the family of his ex-wife in Texas

Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted of committing the 2014 murder of Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring in the state of Texas.

According to the authorities, he entered the Stayów house on July 9, 2014, demanding the disclosure of his wife's whereabouts, Melannie Haskell, with whom he was separated.

She wasn't there, but she was her sister, Katie Stay and her family.

Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4, and two girls aged 9 and 7, were killed when Haskell opened fire, the Harris County Sheriff's Office said.

There lived only one family member, 15-year-old then Cassidy Stay.

The authorities claimed that she was badly wounded, but managed to recover completely.

On Thursday, members of the jury rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the basis of insanity.

The jury will convene again on Monday to issue a verdict.

Quantum internet ever closer to reality-ScienceDaily

The results of the US Army's research are moving the quantum internet a step closer.

Such an internet could offer military capabilities in terms of safety, detection and timing of the maintenance of time not available in the traditional approach to networking.

Site for Distributed Quantum Processing of Military Information Research Laboratory. The development of the US Army combat capability has been looking at researchers from the University of Insbruck, who managed to reach a record transfer of land between matter and light-50 kilometers from the use of fiber-optic cables.

A confusion is a correlation that can arise between quantum such as the cubites.

When two cubites are looted and one of them is measured, this will affect the measurement made on the second one, even if the second cubit is physically dismissed.

"" "These [50 kilometers] are two orders of magnitude further than it was previously possible and it is a feasible distance to begin construction of intercity quantum networks," "said Dr. Ben Lanyon, an experimental physicist from the University of Innsbruck and lead researcher in the project, whose discoveries have been published in the journal Nature, the Quantum Information section. "

The intercities of quantum networks would consist of distant nodes of the physical network of the cubits, which are interconnected despite a large physical distance.

The researchers said it was a dissipation of the spine state necessary for the creation of a quantum internet.

"" "This demonstration is a significant step forward in order to achieve a distributed spate on a large scale," "said Dr. Sara Gamble, a co-managing military program supporting the research."

The quality of the spine condition at the other end of the fiber is also high enough to meet some of the most difficult applications of the quantum networks.

The research team started an experiment from the calcium atom trapped in an ion trap.

With the help of laser beams, the researchers entered the quantum state in jon, simultaneously causing it to emit a photon, in which quantum information was written.

As a result, the quantum states of the atom and the particles of light have been splintered.

The challenge is to upload a photon fiber cable.

"" "The photon emitted by ion calcium has a wavelength of 854 nanometres and is quickly absorbed by the optical fiber," "said Lanyon."

That is why his team initially sent a particle of light through the non-linear crystal illuminated with a strong laser beam.

The wavelength of the photon has been transformed into an optimal value from the point of view of transmission over long distances-the current standard telecommunication of the wavelength is 1550 nanometers.

Then the researchers sent this photon through a 50-kilometer fiber optic cable.

Their measurements show that the atom and light particles were still looted even after the wavelength and the distance traveled.

"" "The decision to choose calcium means that this result will guide the direct route for the creation of a splintered network of atomic clocks at large physical distances, because calcium can be complicit with the high quality cubite of the" "clock" ". "

"The army is very much interested in splinter large-scale clock networks due to the applications for precise positioning, precision navigation and timing synchronization," "said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher who also co-manages the program."

"""This demonstration is a significant step forward in order to achieve a distributed spate on a large scale,"" said Dr. Sara Gamble, a co-managing military program supporting the research."
